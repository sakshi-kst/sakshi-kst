- 👋 Hi!! I’m Sakshi Kulshreshtha, currently working as a Software Engineer - Big Data at the NatWest Group with an experience of 2 years.

- 👀 I am proficient in Java, Python and Big Data tools like PySpark, Airflow, SQL & AWS.
- My current role introduced me to the world of Data and Cloud and I'm especially intrigued by its immense potential and look forward to harness it to solve real- world problems.

- 🌱 I'm currently upskilling myself in Full-stack Development tools like React and NodeJS.
- I also have experience working with DevOps tools and have created CI/CD pipelines to automate processes, saving up to 2.5 man-days/sprint.

- ⏲️ Apart from my love for coding, in my free time I wear various hats as a technical content writer (published 30+ articles at Scaler & [GeeksforGeeks](https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/SAKSHIKULSHRESHTHA/articles)) and as a mentor, guiding people through their technical queries and upskilling them.
